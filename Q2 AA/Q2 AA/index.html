            <p id="par1">In a world so chaotic and swift, issues are growing, little-by-little. People are becoming selfish and harsh. It seems like our world has become a large lair for survival. Communities such as the LGBTQIA+ community are still being discriminated and hated upon. With an inclusive property should come support and love, especially towards communities such as this. Our website hopes to inform people of the beauty of communities while still educating about the struggles that one may face as a member of the community. It is unacceptable to leave issues unattended and communities unloved, especially with our growing world. As we advance with technology, our mindsets should also advance to a more inclusive one. </p>
